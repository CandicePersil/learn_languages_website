	<h1>How to code using Linux and Shell Scripts</h1>
	<h2>Unix commands</h2>
	<h3>Commands and parameters</h3>
	<p>
		First, we have to know what to write in a linux terminal and how to write it.</br>
		In a linuw terminal, we have to write commands. These commands can be used with parameters.</br>
		These ones need to be written this way: me@pc:~$ <strong>command parameter1 parameter2</strong> etc..
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/linux-date.jpg" class="float_image_left" alt="Float_image_left_linux_date"/>
		Linux allows us to display the current date in the terminal by using the date command.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/linux-ls.jpg" class="float_image_right" alt="Float_image_right_linux_ls"/>
		One of the most used command is <strong>ls</strong>. It helps us to display directories and files 
		that are in the current directory.
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/linux-ls-a.jpg" class="float_image_left" alt="Float_image_left_linux_ls_a"/>
		To show you that it does't show every files/directories but only the visible ones, lets create non visible ones.
		As you see, these hiden files and directories have to have a dote before there names to be hiden.
		Then, to see them,<strong>-a</strong> parameter has to be added after ls.</br></br></br></br></br></br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/linux-rm.jpg" class="float_image_right" alt="Float_image_right_linux_rm"/>
		Because I had to create new files that I don't need to have an example, I will have to remove them.
		For that, we use the <strong>rm</strong> command. It exists different associated parameters such as <strong>-r</strong> 
		to remove directories and their contents and <strong>-d</strong> to remove empty directories. </br>
		Of course, when we only use rm, it removes files.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you surely noticed it, we need to write a <strong>-</strong> before writing parameters. But this is only for short ones.
		For longer ones, <strong>--</strong> is writen instead. And as for little parameters we generally write:</br> 
		<strong>command --param1 --param2</br>
		command -parameter1 --param1</strong></br>
		is also possible
	</p>
	<p>
		Ls can also display contents of other directories than the current one. <br>You just have to add the name of the directory 
		if this one is in your current one. So just add the name of the subdirectory you want to display contents</br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/linux-tab-tab.jpg" class="float_image_left" alt="Float_image_left_linux_tab_tab"/>
		A really usefull thing you need to know when using a linux terminal and that you do not remember by heart commands. 
		You can begin to write your command and after stop to complete more when you are not sure of the following part, 
		you can use two times tabulation. It will display all possibilitis our terminal.
	</p>
	<h3>Files and directories</h3>
	<p>
		Something very important to know is that Linux see all its components as files. There is only one root: /.</br>
		Root directories are: bin (exe), boot, dev (input), etc (configuration files), home (personal repositiry of users),</br> 
		lib (shared libraries), media (SD card, etc...), mnt (tmp media), opt (add-ons), proc (system information),</br>
		root (personal root directory), sbin (important system softwares), tmp (temp), usr (softwares used by users)</br>
		and var (variable data).</br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Where are you?</strong></br>
		We use the <strong>pwd</strong> command to display the name of the current directory. We can also use <strong>which</strong> </br>
		to know where is located a command. For exemple: <strong>which ls</strong>, it displays <strong>/usr/bin/ls</strong>. </br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Again ls</strong></br>
		<strong>Ls -l</strong> is used to display a list of detailed elements that are located in the current directory.</br>
		By using <strong>ls -lh</strong> (we added h), file sizes are more understandable.</br>
		<strong>Ls -lt</strong> (we added t), sort files by modification date. Whereas adding <strong>-r to -t</strong>, the list</br>
		is displayed in the other order.</br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Move in directories</strong></br>
		The <strong>cd</strong> command is used to move in a directory by writting the directory name after it.</br>
		Then, <strong>cd ..</strong> is used to go in the parent directory and <strong>cd ../..</strong> to go in the parent parent directory.</br>
		The first remark does not work everywhere. In fact, it only works when the directory you are looking for is in you current directory.</br>
		So, if you want to go in another directory that is not in your current one, you have to specify its parent directory.</br>
		Example: you want to go in directory4 and you are in directory1. You know that directory4 is in a parent directory called pairDirectories.</br>
		So, to go in directory4, write: cd /directories/directory4. That is not so complicated.</br>
		Something essential needs to learnt here: <em>the easiest way to go in your home repository.</em> Just write <strong>cd ~</strong> or <strong>cd</strong>. ;)</br>
	</p>
		<strong>Do your computer need to lose weight?</strong></br>
		<strong>Du</strong> is a command that displays your disk usage. It displays the size of subdirectories of your current directory. If you use <strong>-h</strong>, it is more understandable.</br>
		As <strong>du</strong> only displays the size of directories, by adding -a you also have files size.</br>
		If you have to many subdirectories, you can choose to display the total by using <strong>-s</strong>.
	</p>
	<h3>Lets play with files</h3>
	<p>
		<strong>Display a file</strong></br>
		Commands <strong>cat</strong> and <strong>less</strong> just display contents of a file. When <strong>cat</strong> displays all the contents, <strong>less</strong> displays </br>
		only a part of it. If we had <strong>cat -n</strong>, numbers of lines are also displayed. After you opened your file with <strong>less</strong>, you can navigate inside  using b </br> 
		"back to the beginning of the file", d "go further (11 lines more)", enter "further (1 line)", y "go back (1 line)", u "go back (11 lines)" and q "stop". </br>
		Remember that if you do not know a command use <strong>help</strong>. It works in the open file and will display all commands.<br>
		Something really usefull is also the command used to search for a word. Use <strong>/wordYouSearch</strong> and it will display it in the bottom. Then use <strong>n</strong></br>
		to display the following one or <strong>N</strong> for the previous one. </br></br>
		
		<strong>Display the beginning and the end</strong></br>
		<strong>head</strong> displays the beginning of a file and if you had <strong>-n numberOfLines</strong>, you can choose how many lines you will display. </br>
		The same with <strong>tail</strong>, but it displays the end of a file. </br>
		You can also use with <strong>tail</strong>, <strong>-f</strong> for follow if you file is changing. </br></br>
		
		<strong>create your own files and directories</strong></br>
		The command <strong>touch</strong> can be used to create files. Put you file name with its extension and then you have a file.</br>
		Of course, you can create several files by adding a space between names (it is also possible to create files names with spaces by using "" ;)). </br>
		The command <strong>mkdir</strong> helps you to create directories. You can also create sub ones by using <strong>-p</strong> and directory/subdirectory/subsubdirectory . </br></br>
		
		<strong>Copy past</strong></br>
		Use <strong>cp</strong> but becareful. There are many ways to use CP.</br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Copy a file and create a copy of this one with another name -> <em>cp fichierToCp newFichierCp</em>
			</li>
			<li>
				Copy a file and put it in a directory -> <em>cp fichierToCp aDirectory/</em>
			</li>
			<li>
				Copy a file and create a copy of this one with another name in a directory -> <em>cp fichierToCp aDirectory/newFichierCp</em>
			</li>
			<li>
				Copy a file and in a directory using an absolute path -> <em>cp fichierToCp /aDirectory/aSubDirectory/</em>
			</li>
			<li>
				Copy a directory and all its subdirectories and files and create a new directory -> <em>cp -R directory newDirectory</em>
			</li>
			<li>
				Copy all files with a same extension, same names beginning in a directory -> <em>cp *.txt aDirectory/</em> or <em>cp fileBeginning* aDirectory/</em>
			</li>
		</ul>
		Use <strong>mv</strong> to move a file or a directory in another directory. You can use it as you do with <strong>cp</strong>. </br>
		Use <strong>mv</strong> to rename a file -> <em>mv file newFileName</em>. Or do both with <em>mv file aDirectory/newFileName</em> </br></br>
		
		<strong>Remove a file or a directory</strong></br>
		Use <strong>rm</strong> to remove a file.</br></br>
		
		<strong>Link your files</strong></br>
		You can create a physical link or a symbolic one.</br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Physical link between two files (one file needs to be empty) -> <em>ln emptyFile existingFile</em>
			</li>
			<li>
				Symbolic link between two files (one file needs to be empty) -> <em>ln -s emptyFile existingFile</em>
			</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Are you able to do everything you want to?</h3>
	<p>
		The answer is: it depends on your rights.</br>
		...
	</p>
	<h2>Unix commands</h2>
	<h3>Vim</h3>
	<p>
		We will use vim to create shell scripts</br>
		Important things to know about vim: </br>
		There are 3 modes: Insertion, interactive and command.</br>
		Interactive mode:</br>
		i: insertion</br>
		h, j, k, l: directions</br>
		0 and $: position on the beginning and end of line</br>
		w: move from one word to the next one</br>
		x: remove letters</br>
		u: go back</br>
		ctrl + r: go forward</br>
		(number)u: remove the number of letters given</br>
		dd: remove a line</br>
		(number)dd: remove the number of lines indicated</br>
		-> the lines are not really removed, they are cut</br>
		-> p: can be used just after to past them in another place</br>
		dw: remove a word</br>
		(number)dw: remove this number of words</br>
		d0: remove the beginning of the curent line (before the cursor)</br>
		d$: remove the end of the line (after the cursor)</br>
		yy: copy a line</br>
		yw: copy a word</br>
		(number)p: past "number" times the already cody element</br>
		r: replace a letter (r(letter) with our cursor on the letter 
		to replace)</br>
		(line number)G: go to line number</br>
		G: go to the last line</br>
		gg: go to the first line</br>
		/(word): search for this word in the file, then use "n" to search for 
		the next occurence and "N" for the previous one.<br/>
		?: same than / but from the beginning</br>


		</br>
		Command mode:</br>
		:w -> save the current file</br>
		:w myfile -> save and display "myfile" written</br>
		:q -> quit (close the file)</br>
		:q! -> quit without saving</br>
		:wq -> save and quit</br>
		:s/former/new -> replace the first occurence of the word at 
		the line where is located our cursor</br>
		
		<em>:sp</em> -> split our screen in two parts horizontaly 
		(same file opened twice)</br>
		<em>:sp otherFile</em> -> split our in two with another file</br>
		<em>:vsp</em> -> split our screen in two parts verticaly</br>
		<em>ctrl + w</em> then <em>q</em> to quite the current viewport</br>
