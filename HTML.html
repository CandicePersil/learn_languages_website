		<h1>Learn how to code using different languages</h1>
		<h2>
			<em>Introduction</em>
		</h2>
			<p> 
				The goal of this web page will be to practice html, css and php coding
				and in the same time to display informatin to learn how to code in different 
				other languages.
			</p>
			<p> 
				We will display information about: 
				<ul>
					<strong>
						<li>
							<a href="#HTML_and_CSS">css</a>
						</li> 
						<li>php</li> 
						<li> 
							<a href="SHELL_SCRIPT.html" target="_blank" class="local_page">shell script</a> 
						</li> 
						<li>python</li> 
						<li>java</li>
					</strong>
				</ul> 
				and eventually 
					<strong>c and c++</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				If we have time, we will try to display information on 
				<strong>security</strong>
				,with different type of cryptography methods and network.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, If you liked my courses I will ask you if you want me to add information about 
				<strong>parallel programming using Cilk</strong>.

			<h3>Basic but useful information</h3>
				<p>
					Never forget to include in the beginning !DOCTYPE html and to use the html balise before coding.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can 
					<span class="key_word">comment</span> 
					your html code using < !-- Comment -- >. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="key_word">Links</span> 
					can be used in several ways. In fact, it is possible to create a like to another webpage that exists
					in the web, create a link to another local webpage (one of yours) or to another section of your current webpage 
					usign its ID. To create all these links, we use < a href="" > < / a >. Between "", we can put an internet link 
					such as https://... or webpage.html if you local webpage is in the same directory as your webpage or the id of the 
					section you want to reach using #id where your id has been created using < hx id="id">  < / hx >. You can use, after 
					your href, target="_blank" to open a new tab where will be displayed the page you target.
					To summarize local likes see the above picture.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/differents_liens_relatifs.png" alt="Les_differents_liens_relatifs"/>
					<figcaption>Different relativ links</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Using html, 
					<span class="key_word">images</span> 
					can also be included. For example we can display a picture to show how looks 
					our website by just using html and not css.<br/>
					################################################<br/>
					<img src="images/html_css_part.jpg" alt="Image_showing_html_css_part"></br>
					################################################<br/>
					But be carefull, don't forget to precise the extension .png or .jpg and don't make mistakes when writing 
					the names of the image.<br/> If you make a mistake, you won't be able to visualize your image but you will see:<br/>
					<img src="images/error_visualizing_html_css_part.jpg" alt="error_visualizing_html_css_part"/> <br/>
					It is also possible to include gif. Lets try with an image of a cat ^^:<br/>
					<img src="images/Pusheen-pusheen-the-cat-bike.gif" alt="a_cat_drive_a_bike"/> <br/>
				</p>
				<p>
					Lets start the css (Cascading Style Sheets) part now :>, the language that will make our website beautiful. <br/>
					First we can check the compatibility by showing compatibility tables 
					of HTML and CSS on different WebBrowsers. 
					Go to the website named 
					<a href="http://www.caniuse.com" target="_blank">Caniuse</a>.<br/>
					We will learn to use css by using only a .css file and not the other technics that are said to be of less quality.
					So, first you need to create this file (name is style.css). Then, you will have to "call" this file in you html file 
					to be able to use it. For that, you need to write < link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /> in the header.
					Now, you can use your file :). You can for example change the color of your texts. You did to reference you text 
					so you css file knows which text needs to have a different color. It is written that way: <br/>
					<img src="images/css_example.jpg" alt="Example_of_css"/> </br>
					It is also possible to change the police used for your text. Personaly, I used "Comic Sans MS" as police for 
					all my texts. For that I wrote:</br>
						*/*reference to everything in the page*/</br>
						{</br>
						font-family: "Comic Sans MS", Verdana, sans-serif;</br>
						}</br>
					As you surely noticed, I wrote Verdana and sans-serif. That is because it is possible that the police you have chosen 
					is not taking into account by your WebBrower. That why you can precise a second police and if it doesn't work a kind of 
					default	police.
					About images, it is possible to change their position. We actually can make float images.</br>
					For that, we have to write:</br>
						< img src="image.jpg" class="float_image" alt="Float_image" /></br>
						class float_image will be used in.css as a reference point:</br>
						.float_image //do not forget to put a point before class name</br>
						{</br>
							float: left (or right);//the following text is written on the right(or left) of the image</br>
						}</br>
						Text can also be written under the chosen image by using both in css file:</br>
						.under</br>
						{</br>
							float: both;</br>
						}</br>
				</p>
